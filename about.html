            <p class="description">
               Camiguin is a province rich in culture, known for its vibrant festivals and time-honored traditions that reflect the island’s deep faith and strong community spirit. The most famous celebration is the Lanzones Festival, held every October to honor the bountiful harvest of the sweet lanzones fruit. The festival features street dancing, colorful costumes, cultural shows, and thanksgiving rituals. Another meaningful tradition is the Panaad, where devotees walk around the island during Holy Week as a form of sacrifice and spiritual reflection. Camiguin also observes the San Juan Hibok-Hibok Festival, celebrating local heritage and the island’s history with music, dance, and eco-activities. These festivals not only preserve Camiguin’s cultural identity but also bring the community together in joy and gratitude.

            <h2>Mt. Hibok-Hibok</h2>
            <p class="description">
Camiguin is known as the “Island Born of Fire” because it was shaped by volcanic activity. The island has several volcanoes, but the most famous is Mt. Hibok-Hibok. Its most destructive eruption happened in 1951, when it released deadly lava, ash, and poisonous gases. This eruption killed thousands of people and forced many residents to move to Misamis Oriental. Before this disaster, Hibok-Hibok had also erupted in 1871, which buried the old town of Catarman and created the famous Sunken Cemetery. Another major volcano is Mt. Vulcan, which formed as a result of those eruptions and continues to shape the island’s landscape. Because of its volcanic history, Camiguin has fertile soil, hot springs, and unique land formations—all created by centuries of eruptions and geothermal activity.            </p>

            <h2>Bird Watching</h2>
            <p class="description">
Bird watching in Camiguin is an eco-tourism activity where visitors explore the island’s forests, mountains, wetlands, and coastal areas to observe different species of birds in their natural habitat. Because Camiguin is rich in biodiversity and has well-preserved ecosystems, it has become a peaceful haven for many bird species, including some that are rare or endemic to the Philippines. Popular spots for bird watching include the forests around Mt. Hibok-Hibok, the Timpoong–Hibok-Hibok Natural Monument, and various mangrove areas where migratory birds often stop.        </div>
